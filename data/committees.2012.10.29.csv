Crossroads cannot legally work with or support specific candidates, so the group was running issues ads to promote its agenda, with most of the ads aimed against Claire McCaskill. Crossroads pulled all of its scheduled ads from the states after Todd Akin refused to drop out of the race, following his comments on abortion and ""legitimate rape.""",,
